Description: RNAPeaks creates quality visualizations of RNA-binding
    protein (RBP) peaks overlaid on gene structures. The package provides
    functions for single-gene plots, multi-gene genomic region plots,
    splicing maps that show RBP binding patterns around splice junctions, and sequence motif analysis.
    It integrates with GTF annotations from Ensembl via AnnotationHub and
    supports sequence motif analysis across splicing events.
