\arguments{
\item{SEMATS}{A data frame containing SE.MATS output with columns:
chr, strand, upstreamES, upstreamEE, exonStart_0base, exonEnd,
downstreamES, downstreamEE, GeneID, PValue, FDR, IncLevelDifference,
IJC_SAMPLE_1, SJC_SAMPLE_1, IJC_SAMPLE_2, SJC_SAMPLE_2, IncLevel1, IncLevel2}

\item{sequence}{Character string of the target sequence motif to search for
(e.g., "CCCC", "YGCY"). Supports IUPAC ambiguity codes.}

\item{genome}{A BSgenome object. Default uses BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.}

\item{moving_average}{Integer specifying the window size for moving average
smoothing. Set to NULL or 0 to disable smoothing. Default is 40.}

\item{WidthIntoExon}{Integer specifying how many bp to extend into exons.
Default is 50.}

\item{WidthIntoIntron}{Integer specifying how many bp to extend into introns.
Default is 250.}

\item{p_valueRetainedAndExclusion}{P-value threshold for retained/excluded events.
Default is 0.05.}

\item{p_valueControls}{P-value threshold for control events. Default is 0.95.}

\item{retained_IncLevelDifference}{Inclusion level difference threshold for
retained events. Default is 0.1.}

\item{exclusion_IncLevelDifference}{Inclusion level difference threshold for
excluded events. Default is -0.1.}

\item{Min_Count}{Minimum read count threshold. Default is 50.}

\item{groups}{Character vector specifying which event groups to process.
Options are "Retained", "Excluded", and/or "Control". Default is
c("Retained", "Excluded", "Control") to process all groups. Use
c("Retained", "Excluded") to skip the Control group (which can be large).}

\item{control_multiplier}{Numeric multiplier for control sample size. The
number of control events sampled per iteration is
(n_retained + n_excluded) * control_multiplier. Default is 1.0.}

\item{control_iterations}{Integer number for sampling iterations for control
sampling. The final control frequency is the mean across iterations, with
standard deviation shown as a shaded band. Default is 20.}

\item{cores}{Integer number of cores for parallel processing. Default is 1
(sequential). Set higher for faster processing on multi-core systems.}

\item{z_threshold}{Z-score threshold for significance testing. Default is 1.96
(corresponds to p < 0.05 two-tailed).}

\item{min_consecutive}{Minimum number of consecutive significant positions
required to form a significant region. Default is 10. Helps reduce false
positives from noise.}

\item{show_significance}{Logical. If TRUE (default), displays colored bars above
the plot indicating regions where Retained/Excluded differ significantly
from Control based on z-test.}

\item{return_data}{Logical. If TRUE, returns the frequency data frame instead
of a plot. Default is FALSE.}

\item{return_diagnostics}{Logical. If TRUE, returns a list containing the
frequency data, raw bootstrap iteration results (for normality testing),
and significance results. Useful for validating bootstrap assumptions.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints progress messages. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing sequence frequency across the 4 regions
for Retained (blue), Excluded (red), and Control (black) groups.
Significant regions (z-test vs Control) are shown as colored bars above
the plot. Returns a data frame if return_data = TRUE.
}
\description{
Analyzes the frequency of a target sequence motif across splicing junction
regions. Compares motif frequency between Retained, Excluded, and Control
splicing events to identify position-specific enrichment patterns.
}
\details{
The function divides each splicing event into 4 regions of (WidthIntoExon +
WidthIntoIntron) bp each:
\itemize{
\item Region 1: Upstream exon end to first intron
\item Region 2: First intron end to middle (skipped) exon start
\item Region 3: Middle exon end to second intron
\item Region 4: Second intron end to downstream exon start
}

Events are filtered into three groups:
\itemize{
\item Retained: Significant events (PValue < threshold) with positive inclusion
\item Excluded: Significant events (PValue < threshold) with negative inclusion
\item Control: Non-significant events
}

At each position, the function checks if the target sequence starts there.
The frequency is calculated as: (events with motif at position) / (total events)
