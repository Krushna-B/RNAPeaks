\title{Annotate BED Peaks with Genomic Regions}
\usage{
AnotBed(peak = NULL, enDb = NULL, species = "Human")
}
\arguments{
\item{peak}{A BED data frame or GRanges object containing peaks to annotate.}

\item{enDb}{Optional pre-loaded EnsDb object. If NULL, loaded from AnnotationHub.}

\item{species}{Species for annotation: "Human" or "Mouse".}
}
\value{
A data frame with original peak coordinates plus a \code{Region} column
indicating the genomic feature type:
\describe{
\item{miRNA}{microRNA regions}
\item{CDS}{Coding sequence (exons)}
\item{UTR5}{5' untranslated region}
\item{UTR3}{3' untranslated region}
\item{NCExon}{Non-coding exons (lncRNA)}
\item{SpliceSite5}{5' splice site (50bp flanking)}
\item{SpliceSite3}{3' splice site (50bp flanking)}
\item{Intron}{Intronic regions}
\item{Others}{Intergenic or unclassified}
}
}
\description{
Annotates each peak in a BED file with its genomic region type (CDS, UTR,
intron, splice site, etc.) using Ensembl database annotations.
}
\details{
Peaks are assigned to regions hierarchically - if a peak overlaps multiple
region types, it is assigned to the first matching category in the order
listed above. A peak must have >50\% overlap with a region to be assigned.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Annotate peaks from a BED file
  bed <- read.table("peaks.bed", header = FALSE)
  annotated <- AnotBed(peak = bed, species = "Human")

  # Check region distribution
  table(annotated$Region)
}
}
